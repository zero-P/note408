## Question

### Why chose JNU

I chose Jinan University because of its excellent academic environment. Although Jinan University is well-known for its liberal arts programs, this doesnot mean that its science and engineering disciplines are weak. The Computer Science and Technology discipline at Jinan University is rated as B, while Sun Yat-sen University and South China University of Technology are just rated as B+. During high school, I always dreamed of getting into Jinan University, but due to underperforming in the college entrance exam, it became a regret. Therefore, I hope to make up for that regret by pursuing postgraduate studies.

### Family

There are three people in my family, my parents and I. My father is a coal miner and my mother is a homemaker. My parents are very open-minded and our family atmosphere is very harmonious. Therefore, both in study and life, they give me the right to make choices and respect my decisions, which will subtly cultivate my decision-making and thinking ability, so I will be calmer when I encounter difficulties and solve them independently. I am very grateful for the support my parents have given me, so I will study hard, repay my parents and use all my efforts to make my family better and better.

### Sports/Interest

I like running. I often run five kilometers at the gym after work. I like the sensation of sweating while running. Additionally, running helps me reduce stress and improves my efficiency in both work and studies.

### Advantage/Disadvantage

One of my biggest strengths is that I never give up. When I start something, I stick with it until I finish, no matter how hard it is. 

On the other hand, I can be a bit of a perfectionist. I want everything to be just right, so sometimes I spend too much time on small details. I’m working on finding a balance between doing things well and not overthinking them.

### Help

Thank you for your question. But I'm so sorry that I don't currently know the answer to this question. After the interview, I will study more relevant knowledge.

Sorry, teacher, I didn't hear you clearly, could you repeat it slowly?

## 中文自我介绍

尊敬的各位老师，上午好，很荣幸能参加此次面试，下面请允许我进行自我介绍。

我叫裴治豪，今年26岁，来自安徽淮南，2020 年毕业于华南农业大学。接下来，我将从读研原因、本科经历、读研规划三个方面来介绍自己。

首先我是一名跨考生，我本科专业是生物工程。我第一次真正接触到计算机学科是在大二的公共 C 语言课上，从那以后我便对计算机产生了很大的兴趣。毕业后我成为了一名后端开发工程师，整天和 Java 代码打交道。虽然我已经成为了一名程序员，但我仍然比较遗憾没有在学术环境下系统学习计算机专业知识。另一方面，我的本科专业也限制了我工作的发展，因此，我选择跨考计算机，希望成为一名计算机的科班生。

其次，在我的本科阶段，我担任班级学习委员，并在大二成为了一名预备党员。虽然我对我原来的专业不是太感兴趣，但我还是通过了所有的考试没有挂科，并以平均绩点 3.71 结束了本科四年的学习，虽然我对这个绩点不太满意。

最后，如果我能顺利上岸，成为贵校的一名研究生，我会用新完成以下规划：研一认真学习专业课程，打好理论基础，同时大量阅读研究方向相关的文献，了解利于前沿动态，明确研究兴趣；研二希望能在导师的指导下开展自己的学术研究，尝试提出创新点并撰写论文，多参加学术会议或论坛，与同行多交流，拓宽视野，提升学术表达能力；研三高质量完成毕业论文的研究和写作，争取发表高水平成果。另外参加一些实习，积累实践经验，为毕业后继续深造或顺利就业做好准备。
